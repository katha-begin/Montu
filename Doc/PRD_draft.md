# Montu ‚Äì Full PRD (v0.1 ‚Üí v3.0)

## üåç Product Vision

Montu Manager is a comprehensive DCC-agnostic file, task, and media management ecosystem consisting of four integrated applications for small-to-mid-sized studios, freelancers, and vendor teams. The system helps artists and TDs manage versioned work files, project-specific folder structures, media outputs, and review delivery pipelines across applications like Maya, Nuke, Houdini, Blender, Mari, and Substance.

Targeting both local and remote deployments, the Montu ecosystem adapts dynamically to project specifications, client folder templates, and team review workflows through its integrated application suite.
