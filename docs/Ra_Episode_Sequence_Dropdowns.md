# Ra: Task Creator - Episode and Sequence Dropdowns

## Overview

The manual task creation dialog in Ra: Task Creator now features intelligent dropdown lists for Episode and Sequence fields that automatically populate from existing project data while allowing users to enter new values. This enhancement replaces the previous text input fields with smart combo boxes that provide both selection convenience and input flexibility.

## âœ¨ New Features Implemented

### **Episode Dropdown (QComboBox)**
- **Existing Episodes**: Automatically populated from current project's task database
- **Editable Input**: Users can type new episode names if they don't exist
- **Natural Sorting**: Episodes sorted naturally (Ep01, Ep02, Ep03, Ep10)
- **Project-Specific**: Only shows episodes from the currently selected project
- **Asset Exclusion**: Asset tasks are excluded from episode lists

### **Sequence Dropdown (QComboBox)**
- **Existing Sequences**: Automatically populated from current project's task database
- **Episode Filtering**: Sequences filtered by selected episode when applicable
- **Editable Input**: Users can type new sequence names if they don't exist
- **Natural Sorting**: Sequences sorted naturally (sq010, sq020, sq030, sq100)
- **Dynamic Updates**: Sequence list updates when episode selection changes

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### **Widget Replacement**
```python
# Before: Text input fields
self.shot_episode_edit = QLineEdit()
self.shot_sequence_edit = QLineEdit()

# After: Editable combo boxes
self.shot_episode_combo = QComboBox()
self.shot_episode_combo.setEditable(True)
self.shot_sequence_combo = QComboBox()
self.shot_sequence_combo.setEditable(True)
```

### **Database Integration Methods**

#### **Episode Loading**
```python
def load_episodes(self):
    """Load existing episodes from the current project's tasks."""
    # Query tasks for current project
    tasks = self.db.find('tasks', {'project_id': self.current_project_id})
    episodes = set()
    
    for task in tasks:
        # Get episode from direct field or extract from task_id
        episode = task.get('episode', '')
        if episode and episode not in ['asset']:
            episodes.add(episode)
    
    # Natural sorting and population
    sorted_episodes = sorted(episodes, key=lambda x: (len(x), x.lower()))
    for episode in sorted_episodes:
        self.shot_episode_combo.addItem(episode)
```

#### **Sequence Loading with Filtering**
```python
def load_sequences(self, episode_filter: str = None):
    """Load existing sequences, optionally filtered by episode."""
    tasks = self.db.find('tasks', {'project_id': self.current_project_id})
    sequences = set()
    
    for task in tasks:
        task_episode = task.get('episode', '')
        sequence = task.get('sequence', '')
        
        if episode_filter:
            # Filter by specific episode
            if task_episode.lower() == episode_filter.lower():
                sequences.add(sequence)
        else:
            # All sequences (exclude asset tasks)
            if task_episode not in ['asset']:
                sequences.add(sequence)
    
    # Natural sorting and population
    sorted_sequences = sorted(sequences, key=lambda x: (len(x), x.lower()))
    for sequence in sorted_sequences:
        self.shot_sequence_combo.addItem(sequence)
```

#### **Episode Change Handler**
```python
def on_episode_changed(self):
    """Handle episode selection change to filter sequences."""
    current_episode = self.shot_episode_combo.currentText().strip()
    if current_episode:
        # Reload sequences filtered by selected episode
        self.load_sequences(current_episode)
    else:
        # No episode selected, load all sequences
        self.load_sequences()
```

### **Signal Connections**
```python
# Episode combo connections
self.shot_episode_combo.currentTextChanged.connect(self.update_task_id_preview)
self.shot_episode_combo.currentTextChanged.connect(self.on_episode_changed)

# Sequence combo connections
self.shot_sequence_combo.currentTextChanged.connect(self.update_task_id_preview)
```

### **Project Integration**
```python
def on_project_changed(self):
    """Handle project selection changes."""
    project_id = self.project_combo.currentData()
    self.current_project_id = project_id
    
    if self.current_project_config:
        self.load_project_task_types()
        self.load_asset_categories()
        self.load_episodes()      # Load existing episodes
        self.load_sequences()     # Load all sequences initially
        self.update_existing_tasks_preview()
```

## ðŸ“Š Data Sources and Filtering

### **Episode Data Source**
- **Primary Source**: `episode` field from task documents
- **Fallback Source**: First part of `task_id` or `_id` field (episode_sequence_shot_task format)
- **Filtering**: Project-specific (`project_id` match)
- **Exclusions**: Asset tasks (where episode = 'asset')
- **Sorting**: Natural sorting (Ep01, Ep02, Ep03, Ep10)

### **Sequence Data Source**
- **Primary Source**: `sequence` field from task documents
- **Fallback Source**: Second part of `task_id` or `_id` field (episode_sequence_shot_task format)
- **Filtering**: Project-specific and optionally episode-specific
- **Exclusions**: Asset tasks (where episode = 'asset')
- **Sorting**: Natural sorting (sq010, sq020, sq030, sq100)

### **Dynamic Filtering Behavior**
| Episode Selection | Sequence List Content |
|------------------|----------------------|
| No episode selected | All sequences from project |
| Specific episode selected | Only sequences from that episode |
| New episode entered | All sequences from project (no filtering) |

## ðŸŽ¯ User Experience Benefits

### **Enhanced Workflow**
- **Quick Selection**: Users can quickly select from existing episodes and sequences
- **Consistency**: Promotes consistent naming by showing existing values
- **Flexibility**: Still allows entry of new episodes and sequences when needed
- **Context Awareness**: Sequence list adapts based on episode selection

### **Data Integrity**
- **Reduced Typos**: Dropdown selection reduces manual typing errors
- **Naming Consistency**: Users see existing naming patterns
- **Project Context**: Only relevant episodes and sequences are shown
- **Validation**: Form validation works seamlessly with combo boxes

### **Productivity Improvements**
- **Faster Input**: Selecting from dropdown is faster than typing
- **Discovery**: Users can see what episodes and sequences already exist
- **Smart Filtering**: Sequence filtering reduces cognitive load
- **Autocomplete**: Editable combo boxes provide autocomplete functionality

## ðŸ”„ Backward Compatibility

### **Complete API Compatibility**
- **Method Signatures**: All existing methods work identically
- **Field Access**: Code accessing episode/sequence values works unchanged
- **Validation**: Form validation logic works with combo boxes
- **Task Creation**: Task creation and ID generation work identically

### **Updated Field Access**
```python
# Before (QLineEdit)
episode = self.shot_episode_edit.text().strip()
sequence = self.shot_sequence_edit.text().strip()

# After (QComboBox) - same result
episode = self.shot_episode_combo.currentText().strip()
sequence = self.shot_sequence_combo.currentText().strip()
```

### **Preserved Functionality**
- **Task ID Generation**: Works identically with combo box values
- **Form Validation**: Validates combo box content the same way
- **Task Creation**: Creates tasks with same data structure
- **Database Operations**: All database operations unchanged
