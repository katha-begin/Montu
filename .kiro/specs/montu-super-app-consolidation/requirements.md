# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the consolidation of the existing Montu Manager ecosystem (Task Creator, Project Launcher, and Review Application) into a single unified super application with centralized JSON data management. The goal is to eliminate data fragmentation, reduce resource overhead, and provide a seamless user experience while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Single Application Architecture

**User Story:** As a VFX pipeline user, I want to access all Montu functionality through a single application interface, so that I can manage projects, tasks, and media review without switching between multiple applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user launches Montu Manager THEN the system SHALL present a unified interface with tabbed or panel-based navigation
2. WHEN the user switches between Task Creator, Project Launcher, and Review modes THEN the system SHALL maintain context and data consistency
3. WHEN the user closes the application THEN the system SHALL save the current workspace state and restore it on next launch

### Requirement 2: Centralized JSON Data Management

**User Story:** As a pipeline TD, I want all application data stored in a single centralized JSON database system, so that data consistency is maintained and performance is optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any module accesses data THEN the system SHALL use a single shared JSONDatabase instance
2. WHEN data is modified in one module THEN the changes SHALL be immediately visible in all other modules
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize only one database connection
4. WHEN multiple operations occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent access safely

### Requirement 3: Unified Navigation System

**User Story:** As a user, I want intuitive navigation between different functional areas, so that I can efficiently switch between project management, task creation, and media review workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the main interface THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation options for all functional areas
2. WHEN the user is in any functional area THEN the system SHALL display contextual breadcrumbs showing current location
3. WHEN the user switches functional areas THEN the system SHALL preserve relevant context (selected project, filters, etc.)

### Requirement 4: Shared Component Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want UI components to be shared across functional areas, so that maintenance is simplified and user experience is consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN similar functionality exists across modules THEN the system SHALL use shared UI components
2. WHEN filtering or searching is needed THEN the system SHALL use consistent filter/search interfaces
3. WHEN data display is required THEN the system SHALL use standardized table/list components

### Requirement 5: Legacy Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want my current project data and configurations to work seamlessly with the new unified application, so that I don't lose any work or need to reconfigure settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the unified application starts THEN the system SHALL automatically migrate existing JSON data files
2. WHEN legacy launch scripts are used THEN the system SHALL redirect to the appropriate section of the unified app
3. WHEN existing project configurations are loaded THEN the system SHALL maintain full compatibility

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user working with large datasets, I want the unified application to perform better than the separate applications, so that I can work efficiently with 500+ tasks and multiple media files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading large datasets THEN the system SHALL use lazy loading and pagination
2. WHEN switching between functional areas THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive performance
3. WHEN multiple data operations occur THEN the system SHALL optimize database queries to prevent redundant operations

### Requirement 7: Workspace Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize my workspace layout and have it persist between sessions, so that I can optimize my workflow for different types of work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user arranges panels or tabs THEN the system SHALL save the layout configuration
2. WHEN the user reopens the application THEN the system SHALL restore the previous workspace layout
3. WHEN the user works on different projects THEN the system SHALL optionally save project-specific workspace configurations

### Requirement 8: Data Integrity and Synchronization

**User Story:** As a pipeline TD, I want assurance that data remains consistent across all functional areas, so that I can trust the system for production use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is modified in any functional area THEN the system SHALL immediately update all relevant displays
2. WHEN concurrent operations occur THEN the system SHALL prevent data corruption through proper locking mechanisms
3. WHEN the system detects data inconsistencies THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
